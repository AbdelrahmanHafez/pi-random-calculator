# Pi Random Calculator
## What it is:
This repo answers the following interview question:
You have a funciton that generates a random number between 0 and 1. Calculate the value of Pi.

The question seems strange at first, but it is doable by using some maths.

The trick is drawing X and Y axis, drawing a circle with radius of 1, and a square with the side of 1.
